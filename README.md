# Yelp_Recommendation_System

This is the Yelp recommendation system development competition hosted by the Data Mining course at USC, and I get NO.3 at this competition. This competition provides several datasets such as information of user, business, user reviews, business photo, checkin, and tips. We are expected to build a recommendation system that can predict users' review score on new business and recommend business to users based on predicted score. Datasets provided are huge, for example, the largest dataset contains more than 1.5 million data. Hence, I use spark to extract features from datasets. I build a weighted hybrid recommendation system that integrates item-based collaborative filtering model with XGBoost regressor and use a linear regression to calculate the weight assigned to these two models. I get the RMSE of 0.97 on the validation set and 0.92 on the test set.
